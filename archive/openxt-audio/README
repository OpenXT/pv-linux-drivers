openxt-audio:

PV audio front end driver that works with a separate audio daemon back end
running in dom0. This is a standard ring, grant tables and even channel
front/back type of driver though the backend is in user land.

(NOTE 7/30/2015 this driver has not been maintained and its state as well as
the state of the backend are currently unknown).

(NOTE 5/10/2016 this driver is unmaintained and is no longer being installed
in the Linux tools packages. It has been moved to the archive subdir).
