This is the (currently) experimental new Linux PV USB front end driver that
works with the back end driver in OpenXT. The driver is not currently built
or installed by the DKMS package though the driver is reasonably functional.

What works:
 - Module loading, registration with xenbus.
 - Starting with or plugging in devices.
 - Multiple simultaneous devices.
 - Most devices tried which use bulk or interrupt transfers.
 - Device unplug or disconnect.

What doesn't:
 - Isochronous devices like cameras and microphones.
 - Virtual HCD unloading.
 - Sleep/resume.

If you would like to take it out for a test drive, you can add it back into
the DKMS and Makefiles. The patch add_xc_vusb.patch will put the needed bits
back in place to allow you to build and install the xc-vusb driver.
