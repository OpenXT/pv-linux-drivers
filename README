This repository contains the custom OpenXT PV Linux drivers. Each of these
drivers is a separate DKMS package. The OpenXT build places these packages in
the installers (debs/rpms) on the tools ISO. The driver projects are:

xc-audio:

PV audio front end driver that works with a separate audio daemon back end
running in dom0. This is a standard ring, grant tables and even channel
front/back type of driver though the backend is in user land.

(NOTE 7/30/2015 this driver has not been maintained and its state as well as
the state of the backend are currently unknown).

xc-xenmou:

PV mouse and multi-touch front end driver that uses a device model back end in
QEMU. It uses emulated registers to communicate with the device model and a
logical ring of input events read off a shared page.

xc-v4v:

Interdomain communications driver that interfaces the v4v hypervisor
extensions in OpenXT. The interfacing is done directly through hypercalls and
events are raised using a dedicated VIRQ. All guest to guest communications
is brokered through the hypervisor.

xc-vusb:

PV USB virtual host controller and root hub front end driver that works with
an OpenXT version of the PV USB back end driver. This is a standard ring, grant
tables and even channel front/back type of driver.
