This repository contains the custom OpenXT PV Linux drivers. Each of these
drivers is a separate DKMS package. The OpenXT build places these packages in
the installers (debs/rpms) on the tools ISO. The driver projects are:

openxt-xenmou:

PV mouse and multi-touch front end driver that uses a device model back end in
QEMU. It uses emulated registers to communicate with the device model and a
logical ring of input events read off a shared page.

openxt-vusb:

PV USB virtual host controller and root hub front end driver that works with
an OpenXT version of the PV USB back end driver. This is a standard ring, grant
tables and even channel front/back type of driver.
