This is the (currently) experimental new Linux PV USB front end driver that
works with the back end driver in OpenXT. The driver is not currently built
or installed by the DKMS package though the driver is reasonably functional.

What works:
 - Module loading, registration with xenbus.
 - Starting with or plugging in devices.
 - Multiple simultaneous devices.
 - Most devices tried which use bulk or interrupt transfers.
 - Device unplug or disconnect.
 - Isochronous devices like cameras and microphones.
 - Virtual HCD unloading is prevented but can be overriden.

What doesn't:
 - Sleep/resume.

If you would like to take it out for a test drive, you can build it in a
target VM using the documentation here:
